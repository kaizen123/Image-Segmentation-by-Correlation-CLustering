Image-Segmentation-by-Correlation-CLustering
============================================

1. Libraries used:
VLFeat's SLIC superpixels, SVM training
2. Structure of the code
2.1 Files for Training:
superPixel.m Initial
Superpixel generation code
construct_superPixelGraph.m Constructing
pairwise superpixel graphs from superpixels.
featureExtraction.m Extracting
pairwise features between adjacent superpixels in the
graphs.
ground_truth_by_maximum_consesus.m As
BSD (Berkeley data) gives the ground truth
segmentation by multiple subjects for each image, we form a single ground truth image by
taking the maximum consensus over each segmentation of the image.
assign_label_to_edges.m Using
the ground truth, the edges of the constructed graph are
labeled +1 or 1
train_classifier.m For
the features extracted and the labels assigned to the edges,
the SVM is trained
retrain_classifier.m Retrained
with Hard Negative samples
color_segments.m used
to color the segments in the image for displaying
2.2 Files for Multiple iterations Approach
The folders: order1_files, order2_files, order3_files, order4_files, order5_files,
order6_files, order7_files, order8_files, contain the files for each iteration respectively.
For each iteration, we have,
construct_superPixelGraph.m
featureExtraction.m
assign_label_to_edges.m
superpixels_order.m Generates
the superpixels for the next iteration
2.2 Files for Correlation Clustering:
correlation_clustering.py (
Source https://
github.com/filkry/pycorrelationclustering)
It takes in the input of the edge labeled graph in the form of a text file. The file is parsed to
construct the graph using network library. Correlation clustering is performed on the graph
and the output of clusters formed is given in a text file.
2.3 Files for Evaluation
compare_segmentations.m To
calculate performance measures like Probabilistic Rand
Index and Variation of Information. (Source https://
code.google.com/p/phdworkspace/
source/browse/trunk/Berkeley_Segmentation/segb
ench/SegmentationBenchmark/?r=5)
compare_image_boundary_error.m To
calculate performance measures like Boundary
Displacement Error (Source https://
code.google.com/p/phdworkspace/
source/browse/trunk/Berkeley_Segmentation/segb
ench/SegmentationBenchmark/?r=5)
